            <h4>Bodegas: The Lifesource of NYC Neighborhoods</h4>
            <p>A bodega should be comfortable and familiar. A bodega should be convenient. A bodega should be immigrant-owned. A bodega should have either a fútbol game or any genre of Spanish music playing in the background. A bodega should have buzzing lights hanging overhead that you don’t notice until it's eleven pm and you’re there alone. A bodega should have my papa talk to the owner (or the owner’s son, nephew, or wife) for longer than necessary. A bodega should have kids begging and pleading with their mamis for pre-packaged processed sweets. A bodega should have either made loud bell noises or the loudest creakiest sound you’ll ever hear when its door is opened. And, most importantly, what makes a bodega, a bodega is the presence of at least one cat.</p>
            <p>Anyone who calls themselves a “New Yorker” should have a bodega that they frequent and that, most importantly, that they depend on. A bodega that’s in their very own neighborhood, near their place of work or school, or even near a friend’s place. Bodegas are made to be convenient and dependable, their small size allows regular folk that live in the neighborhood to run them without a corporation funding them. The number of times I’ve walked over to buy a gallon of milk because we had run out and my mother had to make colada for my baby sister is too much. The amount of times where I had to buy a bag of bread with a rumbling stomach because god forbid my family goes without a piece of bread to accompany their coffee, tea, or colada for breakfast is beyond infinity. My dad also runs to the bodega when he has to buy cases of Corona or Modelo Beer for family and friend get-togethers and the owner never asks for I.D. My brother has to get his daily fix of Bimbo Nito™ Duo Chocolate before school and the bodega somehow always keeps up with his demand.</p>
            <p>The decision to walk to the supermarket is fifteen minutes off your lifespan—or the cost of your entire lifespan when it's dark—when a bodega is a block or two away, is a stupid one. New Yorkers already deal with MTA train & bus delays and suspensions. They already live fast and rushed lives. Bodegas can take over opposite street corners or be next to each other depending on the neighborhood's demand. For the quieter, more suburban area, that one bodega saves time than going to the supermarket. For the busy blocks in Manhattan, bodegas pop off in the dozens.</p>
            <p>There are two bodegas that fall into the five-block radius of my building. The greatest mystery of my not-long-ago childhood was why there were two bodegas so close to each other. They’re diagonally opposite from each other separated by a five-road disaster, it’s not a roundabout, and three of the streets are one-way but that does not quell the occasional fast pulse I have. I’ve come to realize that having two bodegas work best when you have this five-road situation. If you’re on one side you go to that bodega, if you’re on the other side you go to the other bodega. What a chore it would be to have to travel across a disaster zone to get to a bodega, it would ruin the convenient nature of them. However, I’ve come to prefer one of the bodegas over the other: the one with the yellow awning instead of the one with the orange awning. The one with the orange awning went over renovations: the lights became brighter and noiseless, the floors shiner, and a new Instagram account accompanied it. Why does a bodega need social media? It’s not like Manhattanites were ever traveling over here for a tiny bodega. The worst part is that they never had a bodega cat. Maybe it was a forewarning. The person behind the counter always rotated between three dudes who talked too much. The bodega with the yellow awning has always had a bodega cat that travels between your legs and the same old dude behind the counter. Bodegas should always be consistent and familiar, their shelves don’t change positions and they don’t employ cashiers that you’ll never see again. But maybe this is the new era of bodegas and everything changes again as nothing stays the same in New York City.</p>
